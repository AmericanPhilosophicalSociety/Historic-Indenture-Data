Abstract: "This large volume contains the records of those entering contracts of indentured servitude in Philadelphia from 1771-1773. The records not only list the name of the person, but contain details on their profession and on the terms of the indenture. Although the volume is described as the records of German immigrants, there are other indentures included, such as that of John Slour, “a free negro,” records of those arriving from Ireland, and of young Philadelphians choosing to enter indentured contracts. The volume had been on loan to the City Archives until 1987. During that time, approximately twenty pages went missing. Otherwise, the volume appears to be complete and contains over 800 pages of records with each page containing information for about four to six individuals. An alphabetical index of names follows page 839."

Data description:
This dataset was created from a volume of over 800 pages that records information pertaining to individuals entering contracts of indentured servitude in Philadelphia from 1771-1773. Each entry contains details about the person to be indentured, including their name, country of origin, length of contract, and amount of debt owed. The records not only list the name of the person, but contain details on their profession and on the terms of the indenture. Although the volume is described as the records of German immigrants, there are other indentures included, such as that of John Slour, "a free negro," records of those arriving from Ireland, and of young Philadelphians choosing to enter indentured contracts.

Each row has been assigned a numerical ID ('Sort ID') to allow sorting while preserving the data's context.


Damage and Lost Data:
The volume had been on loan to the City Archives until 1987. During that time, approximately twenty pages went missing. As indicated in the dataset in the "Transcription Notes" column, the missing data was supplemented where possible by reference to the 1907 printed edition by the Pennsylvania-German Society, which was obtained through the Internet Archive (https://archive.org/details/recordofindentur16phil), although the supplemental data is not formatted identically to the original manuscript.


Assumptions:
Dittos (Do.) are silently corrected and assumed to refer to the information in the above row.


Normalization and Data Standards:
Date is separated into year, month, date. Transcribed comments are generally not normalized, unless damage, foxing, and ink stains make some letters difficult to interpret.

Where families or multiple persons were recorded as part of one contract, they have been assigned individual "transactions" and noted as originally grouped within the "Transcription Notes" column.
